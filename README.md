# Theatria's Website

## Vision Statement

_Theatria's website aims to serve as an engaging and interactive extension of the Theatria Minecraft server experience. We strive to create a central hub for our players where they can interact with their in-game profiles, manage their in-game finances, and stay connected with the server community._

## Core Goals

1. **Player-Centric Experience**: We prioritize security and player privacy, enabling players to confidently link their in-game profiles with the website. Users should be able to log in securely, view their in-game bank balance, manage their profile details, and monitor their in-game progress.

2. **Informative and Supportive Content**: We aim to host a range of content to support both new and experienced players. From latest server updates to helpful guides and tutorials, we want to ensure all our players feel informed and well-supported.

3. **Respect for Good Development Practices**: We aim to write code that's easy to understand and maintain. This includes following widely accepted coding conventions and continuously reviewing and refining our codebase. We're committed to an iterative development process, based on user feedback and evolving needs.
